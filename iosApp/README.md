# iOS App  

This folder contains a placeholder for the iOS application target for the Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile project.  

To set up an iOS application using the shared module, you can create a SwiftUI app in Xcode and link the shared KMM framework generated by the Gradle build.  

1. Run `./gradlew :shared:assembleDebugXCFramework` to build the shared framework.  
2. Open Xcode, create a new iOS app, and add the built `shared.xcframework` as a dependency.  
3. Use the classes in the `shared` module (e.g. `AuthRepository`) from your Swift code.  

For a full KMM iOS setup, consult the official Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile documentation.
